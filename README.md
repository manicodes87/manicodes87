# Hi — I’m Mani 👋

I build practical desktop and web applications with an emphasis on Coolness, AI, local-first tooling, and clean architecture.

## About

I focus on production-ready software: Electron apps, full‑stack services, and ML prototypes that move beyond demos. I like clean code, reproducible experiments, and building tools that actually get used.
I like Anime, Reading Math related books (obssesd with Calculus) and sources, Playing games, Reading up on new technologies and advancements in the world.
